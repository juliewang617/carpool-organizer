# LigerBots Carpool Organizer
An application to organize carpools for my local robotics team.

## Overview

Over the summer, I worked with my local robotics team, the LigerBots, to create a carpool organizer. With over 100 students, organizing carpools to meets and competitions was an arduous process, especially since they were too large to use free organization options. This meant carpools were organized by hand by student leaders and coaches, which took precious time away during build season.

## Development Process

I started by holding meetings with coaches and students to understand their needs, which I documented as user stories and a requirements document. To ensure the design met expectations, I created several mockups, presenting and refining them based on feedback from stakeholders. After nine iterations, the design was finalized.

I also collaborated with a coach to determine the applicationâ€™s data structure and technology stack. We decided on a React JavaScript frontend, a Node.js and Express backend, and a SQLite database, with additional discussions about implementing user authentication. In August, I developed the frontend, carefully designing the UI with React and JavaScript. I focused on writing clear, modular code, using reusable React components to ensure the project could be easily maintained and expanded by future developers.

## Takeaways

This project taught me how to translate user needs into actionable requirements, manage iterative design processes, and deliver a practical solution to a real-world problem. By working directly with stakeholders, I developed a strong understanding of effective communication and project planning.
